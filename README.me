# Voice Agent Tester

## Overview
Voice Agent Tester is an automated voice bot designed to evaluate the performance and reliability of an AI agent. The bot simulates realistic patient interactions, making calls to a test line and engaging in conversations that cover appointment scheduling, rescheduling, medication refills, and general inquiries. Its primary goal is to test the AI system, identify bugs, assess response quality, and explore edge cases. This project demonstrates the ability to build working solutions, handle ambiguous scenarios, and deliver reproducible results.

## Features
- Automated calling to the specified test number.  
- Scenario-based conversations including appointments, cancellations, and medication requests.  
- Recording and transcription of both sides of the conversation.  
- Generation of bug reports highlighting incorrect responses, hallucinations, or awkward phrasing.  
- Modular code structure allowing easy addition of new test scenarios.  

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voice-agent-tester.git
2.	Navigate to the project folder:
3.	cd voice-agent-tester
4.	Install dependencies:
5.	pip install -r requirements.txt
6.	Configure config.py with your local Twilio credentials and ngrok URL. Placeholders are included to avoid pushing real keys.
7.	Run the bot:
8.	python call_trigger.py
Architecture
The system uses Python as the main language, Twilio API for telephony, and ngrok to expose the local server for call handling. Scenario definitions are modular, allowing new test cases to be added easily. Calls are recorded and stored in the transcripts/ folder, while reports documenting AI behavior and detected issues are saved in the reports/ folder. This architecture prioritizes clarity, maintainability, and adaptability for additional scenarios and testing requirements.
